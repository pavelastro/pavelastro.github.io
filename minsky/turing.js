These <b>0</b>'s and <b>1</b>'s describe the new state <i>Q<sub>ij</sub></i> of <i>T</i>, the new symbol <i>S<sub>ij</sub></i> which must eventually be printed in location <b>M</b>, and the direction of motion <i>D<sub>ij</sub></i>. Next, the machine copies the  <b>0'</b>s and <b>l'</b>s representing <i>Q<sub>ij</sub></i> and <i>S<sub>ij</sub></i> into the machine-condition region; it does not print <i>D<sub>ij</sub></i> but just remembers it.'";

This information was retained in the choice between the two exit arrows of [phase ii]. Then the machine shifts to the right and changes all <b>A</b>'s and <b>B</b>'s on the tape to <b>0</b>'s and <b>1</b>'s, except for the <b>A</b> or <b>B</b> in <b>M</b>'s old location that now represents <i>D<sub>ij</sub></i>.

However, instead of encountering the expected <b>0</b> or <b>1</b>, <i>U</i> reads a maliciously placed <b>S</b>. This triggers an implicit quintuple (<i>q<sub>i</sub></i>,<i>s<sub>j</sub></i>,<i>q<sub>i</sub></i>,<i>s<sub>j</sub></i>,<i>d<sub>ij</sub></i>) which causes <i>U</i> to shift further left. Here, it reads a series of <b>A'</b>s, <b>B'</b>s, <b>X'</b>s and <b>Y'</b>s, triggering the same implicit quintuple, shifting the head of <i>U</i> far to the left. The maliciously crafted data thus forces the UTM into a state that Minsky did not consider. Until the end of the next cycle, the UTM is neither executing according to Minsky's intentions nor does it appear to be completely under the attacker's control."
	desc2b = "<i>U</i> continues left until it encounters the first <b>1</b>, where it drops the marker <b>M</b> representing <i>T'</i>s head. <i>U</i> now aims to return to the point of origin, which was marked by an <b>S</b> in the previous phase. However, a maliciously placed <b>S</b> stops <i>U</i> early. At the end of <i>U'</i>s first execution cycle, not only <i>T'</i>s, but also <i>U'</i>s head comes to rest further to the left than expected. Importantly, <i>U'</i>s head is located to the left of the symbol <b>Y</b> indicating the end of <i>T'</i>s tape.";

As seen, that was however not possible. Therefore, looking for <b>0</b>'s and <b>1</b>'s rather than <b>A</b>'s and <b>B</b>'s, <i>U'</i>s head won't find anything in <i>d<sub>I</sub></i>. Instead, it encounters the first match, <b>100</b> just before the <b>Y</b> representing the end of <i>T'</i>s tape. The initial <b>1</b> is the result of <i>T'</i>s first and successful print operation. The ensuing <b>00</b> are simply a part of a buffer between <i>T'</i>s tape and machine condition, Q<sub>T</sub>S<sub>T</sub>.";
	desc4 = "In the second phase of the second cycle, attempting to collect the action part of the identified quintuple, <i>U</i> will find the four digits closest to the right of its head. While these were supposed to constitute the tail end of a quintuple, they are instead pieces of the tape buffer, of <i>T'</i>s machine condition, <i>q(t)s(t)</i>, and <i>T'</i>s first quintuple, jointly creating the string <b>0010</b>, which is thus interpreted as <i>Q<sub>ij</sub>S<sub>ij</sub>D<sub>ij</sub></i>. Furthermore, in the middle of the attempt to copy the first three digits to the injected machine condition, <i>q(i)s(i)</i>, <i>U</i> slips back to the right of the <b>Y</b> indicating the start of <i>T'</i>s machine condition, <i>q(t)s(T)</i>. The end result is that the first digit is copied to <i>q(i)</i> while the remaining part is copied to <i>q(t)s(t)</i>. The UTM now behaves as a <i>weird machine</i> as detailed in <i>Bratus.
